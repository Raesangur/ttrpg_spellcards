If it's turned inside out, the items inside spill out unharmed, but the sack must be put right before it can be used again. A living creature placed inside the sack has enough air for 10 minutes before it begins to suffocate, and it can attempt to Escape against a DC of 13. An item inside the sack provides no benefits unless it's retrieved first. An item in the sack can't be detected by magic that detects only things on the same plane.",
